## 💡 Learning Philosophy (70-20-10)

- **70%** - Build projects, write code, implement features
- **20%** - Study theory just-in-time when you need it
- **10%** - Explore: read blogs, study other code, experiment

**Key**: Theory follows practice. Learn concepts when you feel the pain they solve.

## 🎓 Success Indicators

### You're Ready to Move Forward When:
- [ ] Can explain concepts to someone else
- [ ] Could rebuild the project faster

## 🔥 Motivation Reminders

### When You Feel Stuck
- **This is normal!** Being stuck is where learning happens
- Take a 30-minute break
- Review what you've already built
- Remember: every expert was once a beginner

### When Progress Feels Slow
- You're learning deeply, not just skimming
- Quality over speed
- Compare yourself to last week, not others

### When Motivation Dips
- Review `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - look how far you've come!
- Take a full day off
- Share your work with others
- Remember why you started
