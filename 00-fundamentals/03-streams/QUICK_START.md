# 🚀 Quick Start - Node.js Streams

Get started with streams in 5 minutes!

## 1. Run Your First Example

```bash
cd 00-fundamentals/03-streams/examples
node 01-streams-intro.js
```

This introduces you to:

- What streams are
- Four types of streams
- Why they matter
- When to use them

## 2. See Streams in Action

```bash
node 02-readable-streams.js
```

Watch real streams process data in real-time!

## 3. Learning Path

### Beginner (Start Here)

```bash
# Concepts and basics
node 01-streams-intro.js     # Theory
node 02-readable-streams.js   # Reading
node 03-writable-streams.js   # Writing
```

### Intermediate

```bash
# Combining streams
node 04-piping-streams.js     # Piping
node 05-transform-streams.js  # Transforming
```

### Advanced

```bash
# Production ready
node 06-backpressure.js       # Flow control
node 07-error-handling.js     # Error handling
```

## 4. Try an Exercise

Once you've run examples 1-3, try Exercise 1:

```bash
cd ../exercises
cat exercise-1-log-processor.md
```

Build a log file analyzer with streams!

## 5. Keep the Cheat Sheet Handy

```bash
cd ..
cat CHEAT_SHEET.md
```

Quick reference for all stream APIs.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Read the output** - Examples have detailed console logs
2. **Modify and experiment** - Change values, see what happens
3. **Run multiple times** - Understanding comes with repetition
4. **Check memory** - Use Activity Monitor to see low usage
5. **Complete exercises** - Real learning comes from building

## 🎯 Goal

By the end, you should be able to:

- Process multi-GB files with < 100MB memory
- Build streaming data pipelines
- Handle backpressure correctly
- Write production-ready stream code

## ⏱️ Time Investment

- **Examples**: 4-6 hours (run all, understand each)
- **Exercise 1**: 30-45 min (beginner)
- **Exercise 2**: 45-60 min (intermediate)
- **Exercise 3**: 60-90 min (advanced)

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. Check the example that covers your topic
2. Look up the API in CHEAT_SHEET.md
3. Read the full README.md
4. Review Node.js official docs

## Next Command

```bash
node examples/01-streams-intro.js
```

Let's go! 🌊
