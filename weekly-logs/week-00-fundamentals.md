## 📅 Daily Log

### Tuesday, November 5, 2025

**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**What I Did**:

1. ✅ Organized repository structure with learning materials
2. ✅ Created complete 20-week learning framework
3. ✅ Installed PostgreSQL 18.0 via Homebrew
4. ✅ Configured PostgreSQL service and PATH
5. ✅ Verified installation and database connectivity
6. ✅ Documented setup process in detail

**Technical Setup Completed**:

- PostgreSQL 18.0 (Homebrew) installed and running
- Service configured to auto-start
- `psql` command working
- Default database accessible
- All dependencies installed (icu4c, krb5, etc.)

**What I Learned**:

- PostgreSQL on Apple Silicon uses native ARM64 builds (optimal performance)
- Homebrew's "keg-only" installations require manual PATH setup
- PostgreSQL 18 includes improved SQL/JSON support
- Default peer authentication works for local development (no password needed)
- Service management via `brew services` is clean and reliable
- **Daemons**: Background processes that run continuously (like postgres, redis)
  - Run invisibly, provide services to other programs
  - Auto-restart if they crash, auto-start on login
  - Convention: often named with 'd' suffix (httpd, sshd, mysqld)
- **brew services**: User-friendly wrapper around macOS launchctl
  - Simplifies daemon management (start/stop/restart)
  - Creates Launch Agent plist files automatically
  - Much easier than manual launchctl commands

### Wednesday, November 6, 2025

**Time Spent**: 30 minutes

**What I Did**:

1. ✅ Installed Redis 8.2.3 via Homebrew
2. ✅ Started Redis as a background service
3. ✅ Verified Redis installation and connectivity
4. ✅ Tested basic Redis operations
5. ✅ Documented Redis setup process

**Technical Setup Completed**:

- Redis 8.2.3 (latest stable) installed and running
- Service configured as daemon
- `redis-cli` command working
- Connection test successful (PING → PONG)
- Default port 6379 available

**What I Learned**:

- Redis is significantly lighter than PostgreSQL (~10MB vs ~100MB)
- Redis 8.2.3 uses native Apple Silicon kqueue for event notification
- Protected mode enabled by default (secure for local dev)
- Data persists via RDB snapshots + AOF (Append Only File)
- Redis runs on port 6379, no conflict with PostgreSQL (5432)
- In-memory storage provides microsecond latency (vs milliseconds for disk)
- Both database and cache now ready for URL Shortener project

**Challenges Faced**:

None - installation was smooth after PostgreSQL experience

**Resources Used**:

- Redis documentation
- Previous daemon/brew services knowledge from yesterday
- Homebrew's "keg-only" installations require manual PATH setup
- PostgreSQL 18 includes improved SQL/JSON support
- Default peer authentication works for local development (no password needed)
- Service management via `brew services` is clean and reliable
- **Daemons**: Background processes that run continuously (like postgres, redis)
  - Run invisibly, provide services to other programs
  - Auto-restart if they crash, auto-start on login
  - Convention: often named with 'd' suffix (httpd, sshd, mysqld)
- **brew services**: User-friendly wrapper around macOS launchctl
  - Simplifies daemon management (start/stop/restart)
  - Creates Launch Agent plist files automatically
  - Much easier than manual launchctl commands

**Challenges Faced**:

- `psql` command not found initially after installation
- **Solution**: Added PostgreSQL bin directory to PATH in `.zshrc`
- **Learning**: Homebrew doesn't symlink versioned packages by default

**Resources Used**:

- PostgreSQL 18 documentation
- Homebrew formula reference
- Setup guide created in `docs/project-meta/2025-11-05_SETUP_LOG.md`
- Daemon & brew services guide in `resources/tools/brew-services-and-daemons.md`

## 💡 Key Insights

### Technical

1. **PostgreSQL 18 Features**: Latest version brings performance improvements and better JSON support - good for modern APIs
2. **ARM64 Native**: Using native Apple Silicon builds ensures best performance (no Rosetta translation)
3. **Development Setup**: Direct install is indeed simpler for learning - can focus on Node.js without Docker complexity
4. **Background Services**: Daemons run continuously in background, providing services without manual intervention
5. **Service Management**: `brew services` wraps macOS launchctl, making daemon control user-friendly

### Learning Approach

1. **Documentation First**: Thorough documentation of setup helps when troubleshooting later
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Starting with direct install before Docker is the right call - one new thing at a time
3. **Git Tracking**: Using dated files in `project-meta/` creates good historical record
4. **Deep Understanding**: Don't just run commands - understand what they do (daemons, services, etc.)

## 🤔 Questions & Notes

### Questions to Research

- [ ] What are the main differences between PostgreSQL 18 and 17?
- [ ] When should I use connection pooling in Node.js?
- [ ] How does libuv thread pool size affect database connections?
- [x] What is a daemon? → Background process running continuously
- [x] What is brew services? → macOS service management wrapper for launchctl
- [x] How do services auto-start on macOS? → Launch Agents in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

### Notes for Next Time

- Remember to stop PostgreSQL/Redis services when not in use (save battery)
- Use `brew services list` to check what's running
- Create project databases with descriptive names
- Document connection strings for each project
- Redis is much lighter than PostgreSQL - can keep running
- Both services now ready for URL Shortener project

## 🎨 Reflections

### What Went Well

- ✅ Smooth PostgreSQL installation with no major issues
- ✅ Good documentation habit established from day 1
- ✅ Repository structure is clear and well-organized
- ✅ Setup logging will be valuable reference later
- ✅ Asked questions about unfamiliar concepts (daemons, brew services)
- ✅ Created comprehensive reference guides for future use

### What Could Be Better

- ⚠️ Could have researched PATH setup before installation (would have saved 5 min)
- ⚠️ Should verify all prerequisites before starting (check Node.js version, etc.)

### Surprises

- 😮 PostgreSQL 18 is very recent (released Oct 2024) - cutting edge!
- 😮 ARM64 native build is noticeably fast to start
- 😮 No password needed for local development (peer authentication)
- 😮 PostgreSQL spawns multiple helper processes (not just one daemon)
- 😮 brew services creates Launch Agent files automatically
- 😮 Daemons can auto-restart if they crash (KeepAlive configuration)
