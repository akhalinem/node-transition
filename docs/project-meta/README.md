# Project Meta Documentation

This folder contains meta-documentation about the repository structure and organization decisions.

## Purpose

These files are historical references for understanding:
- **Why** the repository is structured this way
- **What** design decisions were made
- **How** the organization evolved over time

## File Naming Convention

All files use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md`

This ensures:
- ✅ Chronological ordering
- ✅ Unique filenames for future additions
- ✅ Clear historical context

## Files

### 2025-11-05_ORGANIZATIONAL_PLAN.md
The original comprehensive planning document that defined:
- Proposed folder structure
- Rationale for each organizational decision
- File naming conventions
- Navigation strategy
- Implementation phases

**Use this when**: You need to understand why certain structural decisions were made, or you want to replicate this structure for another project.

### 2025-11-05_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md
One-time completion checklist documenting:
- What was created during initial setup
- What moved where
- Current state of the repository
- Next steps at that time

**Use this when**: You need to see what the initial reorganization included, or understand the starting point of the project.
