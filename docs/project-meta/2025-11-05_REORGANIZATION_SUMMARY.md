## 🚀 What Changed from Original

### Moved & Organized
- `01-event-loop/` → `00-fundamentals/01-runtime-architecture/01-event-loop/`
- `02-v8-engine/` → `00-fundamentals/01-runtime-architecture/02-v8-engine/`
- `03-libuv-threadpool/` → `00-fundamentals/01-runtime-architecture/03-libuv-threadpool/`
- `exercises/` → `00-fundamentals/01-runtime-architecture/exercises/`
- `VISUAL_GUIDE.md` → `00-fundamentals/VISUAL_GUIDE.md`
- `LEARNING_GUIDE.md` → `00-fundamentals/01-runtime-architecture/README.md`

### Everything Still Works!
All your existing code examples are intact, just better organized now.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps - Start Your Journey!

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. **Read** `GETTING_STARTED.md` - Complete orientation
2. **Review** `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - Understand success metrics
3. **Check** your prerequisites (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker)

### Day 1 (Week 0.5)
1. **Start** with `00-fundamentals/README.md`
2. **Begin** `01-runtime-architecture/` (you already have great materials here!)
3. **Run** the examples you created:
   ```bash
   cd 00-fundamentals/01-runtime-architecture
   node 01-event-loop/event-loop-phases.js
   ```

### Week 1 Planning
1. After fundamentals, move to `01-project-url-shortener/`
2. Read the project README (fully detailed!)
3. Start building!

---

## 📋 To-Do: Complete the Structure

### Fundamentals Topics to Add (Optional)
The runtime architecture (01) is complete! These are optional for now:
- [ ] 02-module-system materials
- [ ] 03-streams materials
- [ ] 04-buffers materials
- [ ] 05-error-handling materials
- [ ] 06-process-globals materials
- [ ] 07-async-patterns materials

**Note**: You can research these independently using the resources linked in each README, or I can help create materials for them later!

### Project Templates (As Needed)
- [ ] Create detailed READMEs for projects 2-5 (similar to project 1)
- [ ] Create THEORY_CHECKPOINTS.md for each project
- [ ] Create RETROSPECTIVE_TEMPLATE.md for each project

**Note**: These will be created as you progress through projects!

---

## 💡 How to Use This Structure

### Progressive Learning
1. **Don't skip ahead** - Each phase builds on previous
2. **Use theory folders** - Study just-in-time when you need it
3. **Track weekly** - Fill out weekly logs
4. **Update progress** - Check off items in PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

### When Building Projects
1. Read the project README first
2. Check THEORY_CHECKPOINTS.md to know when to pause
3. Use the `planning/` folder for design docs
4. Refer to `theory/` folder when needed
5. Document in `docs/` as you build
6. Complete retrospective at the end

### Staying Organized
- **Commit often** with good messages
- **Update weekly logs** every Sunday
- **Review progress tracker** monthly
- **Keep notes** in theory folders

---

## 🎓 What You Have Now

### Complete & Ready to Use
- ✅ Runtime architecture learning materials (event loop, V8, libuv)
- ✅ Visual guide with diagrams
- ✅ Exercises for runtime architecture
- ✅ Getting started guide
- ✅ Progress tracking system
- ✅ Project 1 complete guide
- ✅ Weekly log template
- ✅ Complete folder structure for 20 weeks

### Placeholders (Add As Needed)
- 📝 Other fundamental topics (can research independently)
- 📝 Detailed guides for projects 2-5 (create when you reach them)
- 📝 Theory materials per project (just-in-time learning)

---

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your repository is now a complete learning system for your 20-week backend engineering journey.

### Start Command
```bash
# Read this first
cat GETTING_STARTED.md

# Then begin!
cd 00-fundamentals/01-runtime-architecture
cat README.md

# Run your first example
node 01-event-loop/event-loop-phases.js
```

### Remember
- **70%** Building (projects)
- **20%** Theory (just-in-time)
- **10%** Exploration (blogs, other code)

**Every expert was once a beginner. Your journey starts now! 🚀**
